# Lab 2: Advanced Traffic Management with NGINX for Azure

## Overview
Welcome to **Lab 2**. In this session of **"Mastering cloud-native app delivery: Unlocking advanced capabilities and use cases with F5’s ADCaaS,"** we move beyond basic connectivity to functional load balancing. 

In this module, you will configure your NGINX for Azure instance to route traffic to a backend application running on a pre-provisioned Linux workload using the Azure Portal.

---

## 🏗️ Pre-provisioned Infrastructure
To focus specifically on NGINX configuration, the following backend resources have been pre-deployed for you:

* **Ubuntu VM:** A Linux virtual machine running a Dockerized "Cafe" application.
* **Internal IP:** Your instructor will provide the internal IP of your Ubuntu VM (e.g., `n4a-ubuntuvm`).

---

## 🚀 Lab Exercises

### Configure NGINX for Azure to Load Balance Docker Containers

In this section, we will configure NGINX for Azure to load balance traffic to the Docker containers running on your Ubuntu VM.

#### 1. Access the Configuration Editor
1. Open the **Azure Portal** and navigate to your **Resource Group**. 
2. Click on your NGINX for Azure resource (usually named **nginx4a**), which will open the Overview section. 
3. From the left pane, click on **NGINX Configuration** under the Settings section.

#### 2. Create the Upstream Configuration
 1. Click on **+ New File** to create a new NGINX config file. 
 2. Name the new file: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/cafe-docker-upstreams.conf`.
   > **Important:** You must use the full Linux `/directory/filename` path for every config file. The Azure Portal does not support drag-and-drop.
 3. Copy and paste the following contents into the editor:

```nginx
# Nginx 4 Azure, Cafe Nginx Demo Upstreams
# cafe-nginx servers
#
upstream cafe_nginx {
    zone cafe_nginx 256k;
    
    # These correspond to the ports exposed by the Docker containers
    server n4a-ubuntuvm:81;
    server n4a-ubuntuvm:82;
    server n4a-ubuntuvm:83;

    keepalive 32;
}
```
 4. Click Submit to save this part of the configuration.

#### 3. Create the Virtual Server Configuration

  1. Click + New File again.

  2. Name the second file: /etc/nginx/conf.d/cafe.example.com.conf.

  3. Copy and paste the following contents into the editor:

  ```nginx 
   # Nginx 4 Azure - Cafe Nginx HTTP
server {
    
    listen 80;      # Listening on port 80

    server_name cafe.example.com;   # Set hostname to match in request
    status_zone cafe.example.com;   # Metrics zone name

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/cafe.example.com.log main;
    error_log   /var/log/nginx/cafe.example.com_error.log info;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://cafe_nginx;        # Proxy and load balance to the upstream group
        add_header X-Proxy-Pass cafe_nginx;  # Custom verification header
    }
}
```

 4. Click Submit to save.

#### 4. Create a Mime Types file
1. A mime.types file is required for the NGINX server configuration
2. Click + New File again.
3. Name the new file: /etc/nginx/mime.types
4. Copy and paste the following contents into the editor:

```nginx
types {
    text/html                             html htm shtml;
    text/css                              css;

}
```

#### 5. Update the Main NGINX Configuration
1. You must now include these new files into your main nginx.conf.

2. Select the nginx.conf file in the editor file tree.

3. Replace the existing content with the following:

```nginx 
# Nginx 4 Azure - Default - Updated Nginx.conf
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;
worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;
pid /run/nginx/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 4000;
}

error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log error;

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
                      
    access_log off;
    server_tokens "";
    
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name localhost;
        location / {
            root /var/www;
            index index.html;
        }
    }

    # Load the modular files created in previous steps
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```
3.  Click the Submit button. NGINX will validate your configuration. If successful, it will reload with your new settings.


### Test your Nginx for Azure configuration

1. For easy access your new website, update your local system's DNS `/etc/hosts` file. You will add the hostname `cafe.example.com` and the Nginx for Azure Public IP address, to your local system DNS hosts file for name resolution.  Your Nginx for Azure Public IP address can be found in your Azure Portal, under `n4a-publicIP`.  Use vi tool or any other text editor to add an entry to `/etc/hosts` as shown below:

    ```bash
    cat /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 localhost
    ...

    # Nginx for Azure testing
    11.22.33.44 cafe.example.com

    ...
    ```

    where
   - `11.22.33.44` replace with your `n4a-publicIP` resource IP address.

1. Once you have updated the host your /etc/hosts file, save it and quit vi tool.

1. Using a new Terminal, send a curl command to `http://cafe.example.com`, what do you see ?

    ```bash
    curl -I http://cafe.example.com
    ```

    ```bash
    ##Sample Output##
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Thu, 04 Apr 2024 21:36:30 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    Expires: Thu, 04 Apr 2024 21:36:29 GMT
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    X-Proxy-Pass: cafe_nginx
    ```

    Try the coffee and tea URLs, at http://cafe.example.com/coffee and http://cafe.example.com/tea.

    You should see a 200 OK Response.  Did you see the `X-Proxy-Pass` header - set to the Upstream block name?  

1. Now try access to your cafe application with a Browser. Open Chrome, and nagivate to `http://cafe.example.com`. You should see an `Out of Stock` image, with a gray metadata panel, filled with names, IP addresses, URLs, etc. This panel comes from the Docker container, using Nginx $variables to populate the gray panel fields. If you Right+Click, and Inspect to open Chrome Developer Tools, and look at the Response Headers, you should be able to see the `Server and X-Proxy-Pass Headers` set respectively.

![Cafe Out of Stock](images/lab2_cafe-out-of-stock.png)

Click Refresh serveral times.  You will notice the `Server Name` and `Server Ip` fields changing, as N4A is round-robin load balancing the three Docker containers - docker-web1, 2, and 3 respectively.  If you open Chrome Developer Tools, and look at the Response Headers, you should be able to see the Server and X-Proxy-Pass Headers set respectively.

![Cafe Inspect](images/lab2_cafe-inspect.png)

Try http://cafe.example.com/coffee and http://cafe.example.com/tea in Chrome, refreshing several times.  You should find Nginx for Azure is load balancing these Docker web containers as expected.

>**Congratulations!!**  You have just completed launching a simple web application with Nginx for Azure, running on the Internet, with just a VM, Docker, and 2 config files for Nginx for Azure.  That pretty easy, not so hard now, was it?
