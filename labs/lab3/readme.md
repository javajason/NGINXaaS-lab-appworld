# Azure Montoring / Logging Analytics

## Introduction

In this lab, you will explore Azure based monitoring and Logging capabilities. You will create the basic access log_format within NGINX for Azure resource. As the basic log_format only contains a fraction of the information, you will then extend it and create a new log_format to include much more information, especially about the Upstream backend servers. You will add access logging to your NGINX for Azure resource and finally capture/see those logs within Azure monitoring tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the lab you will be able to:

- Enable basic log format within NGINX for Azure resource

- Create enhance log format with additional logging metrics

- Test access logs within log analytics workspace

- Explore Azure Monitoring for NGINX for Azure

## Pre-Requisites

- Within your NGINX for Azure resource, you must have enabled sending metrics to Azure monitor.
  
- You must have created `Log Analytics workspace`.
- You must have created an Azure diagnostic settings resource that will stream the NGINX logs to the Log Analytics workspace.
- See `Lab1` for instructions if you missed any of the above steps.

### Enable basic log format

1. Within Azure portal, open your resource group and then open your NGINX for Azure resource (nginx4a). From the left pane click on `Settings > NGINX Configuration`. This should open the configuration editor section. Open `nginx.conf` file.

    ![NGINX Config](images/lab6_nginx_conf_editor.png)

1. You will notice in previous labs, you have added the default basic log format inside the `http` block within the `nginx.conf` file as highlighted in above screenshot. You will make use of this log format initially to capture some useful metrics within NGINX logs.

    ```nginx
    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                    '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
    ```

1. Update the `access_log` directive to enable logging. Within this directive, you will pass the full path of the log file (eg. `/var/log/nginx/access.log`) and also the `main` log format referenced above. Click on `Submit` to apply the changes.

    ```nginx
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
    ```

    ![Access log update](images/lab6_main_access_log_update.png)

1. In subsequent sections you will test out the logs inside log analytics workspace.

### Create enhance log format with additional logging metrics

In this section you will create an extended log format which you will use with `cafe.example.com` server's access log.

1. Within the NGINX for Azure resource (nginx4a), open the `Settings > NGINX Configuration` pane.

1. Within the `nginx.conf` file, in the http context (just after the “log_format  main” directive), add a new extended log format named `main_ext` as shown in the below screenshot. Click on `Submit` to save the config file

    ```nginx
    # Extended Log Format
    log_format  main_ext    'remote_addr="$remote_addr", '
                            '[time_local=$time_local], '
                            'request="$request", '
                            'status="$status", '
                            'http_referer="$http_referer", '
                            'body_bytes_sent="$body_bytes_sent", '
                            'Host="$host", '
                            'sn="$server_name", '
                            'request_time=$request_time, '
                            'http_user_agent="$http_user_agent", '
                            'http_x_forwarded_for="$http_x_forwarded_for", '
                            'request_length="$request_length", '
                            'upstream_address="$upstream_addr", '
                            'upstream_status="$upstream_status", '
                            'upstream_connect_time="$upstream_connect_time", '
                            'upstream_header_time="$upstream_header_time", '
                            'upstream_response_time="$upstream_response_time", '
                            'upstream_response_length="$upstream_response_length", ';
    ```

    ![Extended log format add](images/lab6_main_ext_logformat_add.png)

1. Once the extended log format has been created, open `cafe.example.com.conf` file and update the `access_log` to make use of the extended log format as shown in the below screenshot. Be sure `access_log` is not still set to main in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. If it is, comment that line out by adding a “#” to the beginning of the line. Click on `Submit` to apply the changes.

    ```nginx
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/cafe.example.com.log main_ext;
    ```

    ![cafe access log format update](images/lab6_cafe_access_log_update.png)

1. In the next section, you will test out the extended log format within inside log analytics workspace.

### Test the access logs within log analytics workspace

1. To test out access logs, generate some traffic on your `cafe.example.com` server.

1. You can generate some traffic using your local Docker Desktop. Start and run the `WRK` load generation tool from a container using below command to generate traffic:


    Make request to the default server block which is using the `main` log format for access logging by running below command.

    ```bash
    sudo docker run --name wrk --rm elswork/wrk -t4 -c200 -d1m --timeout 2s http://$MY_N4A_IP
    ```

    Make request to the `cafe.example.com` server block which is using the `main_ext` log format for access logging by running below command.

    ```bash
    sudo docker run --name wrk --rm elswork/wrk -t4 -c200 -d1m --timeout 2s -H 'Host: cafe.example.com'  http://$MY_N4A_IP/coffee
    ```

1. Within Azure portal, open your NGINX for Azure resource (nginx4a). From the left pane click on `Monitoring > Logs`. (If you receive a pop-up tutorial window you can dismiss it.) `NGINXaaS` may already be selected as the Resource type in the top-middle of the page. If not, Select Resource type from drop down and then type in NGINXaaS in the search box. This should open a new Query pane. Select `Resource type` from drop down and then type in `nginx` in the search box. This should show all the sample queries related to NGINX for Azure. Under `Show NGINXaaS access logs` click on `Run` button

    ![nginx4a logs](images/nginx4a_logs.png)

1. This should open a `new query` window, which is made up of a query editor pane at the top and query result pane at the bottom as shown in the below screenshot.

    ![default query](images/lab6_default_query.png)

    > **NOTE:** The logs may take couple of minutes to show up. If the results pane doesn't show the logs then wait for a minute and then click on the `Run` button to run the query again.

1. Azure makes use of Kusto Query Language(KQL) to query logs. Have a look in the [references](#references) section to learn more about KQL.

1. You will modify the default query to show logs for `cafe.example.com` server block. Update the default query with the below query in the query editor pane. Click on the `Run` button to execute the query.

    ```kql
    // Show NGINXaaS access logs 
    // A list of access logs sorted by time. 
    NGXOperationLogs
    | where FilePath == "/var/log/nginx/cafe.example.com.log"
    | sort by TimeGenerated desc
    | project TimeGenerated, FilePath, Message
    | limit 100
    ```

    ![cafe query](images/lab6_cafe_query.png)

1. Within the Results pane, expand one of the logs to look into its details. You can also hover your mouse over the message to show the message details as shown in below screenshot. Note that the message follows the `main_ext` log format.

    ![cafe query details](images/lab6_cafe_query_details.png)

1. You can save the custom query if you wish by clicking on the `Save` button and then selecting `Save as query`. Within the `Save as query` pane provide a query name and optional description and then finally click on `Save` button.

    ![cafe query save](images/lab6_cafe_query_save.png)


### Explore Azure Monitoring for NGINX for Azure

1. Now generate some steady traffic using your local Docker Desktop. Start and run the `WRK` load generation tool from a container using below command to generate traffic:

    ```bash
    sudo docker run --name wrk --rm elswork/wrk -t4 -c200 -d30m --timeout 2s http://cafe.example.com/coffee
    ```

    The above command would run for 30 minutes and send request to `http://cafe.example.com/coffee` using 4 threads and 200 connections.

1. Within Azure portal, open your NGINX for Azure resource (nginx4a). From the left pane click on `Monitoring > Metrics`. This should open a new Chart pane as shown in below screenshot.

    ![default chart](images/lab3_default_chart.png)

1. For the first chart, within **Metric Namespace** drop-down, select `NGINXaaS standard metrics`. For the **mMtric** drop-down, select `Server zone HTTP requests`. For the **Aggregation** , select `Sum`.

   Click on the **Apply Splitting** button. Within the **Values** drop-down, select `server_zone`. From top right change the **Time range** to `Last 30 minutes` and click on `Apply`. This should generate a chart similar to the below screenshot.

    ![server zone request chart](images/lab3_server_request_chart.png)


1. You will now save this chart in a new custom dashboard. Within the chart pane, click on `Save to dashboard > Pin to dashboard`.

    Within the `Pin to dashboard` pane, select the `Create new` tab to create your new custom dashboard. Provide a name  for your custom dashboard. Once done click on `Create and pin` button to finish dashboard creation.

    ![Create Dashboard](images/lab3_create_dashboard.png)

1. To view your newly created dashboard, within Azure portal, search for `Dashboard` and select `Dashboard hub`.

    This should open the `Dashboard hub` page. From the top drop-down select your custom dashboard name (`Nginx4a Dashboard`in the screenshot). This should open your custom dashboard which includes the pinned server request chart.

    ![show dashboard](images/lab3_show_dashboard.png)

1. Now you will add some more charts to your newly created dashboard. Navigate back to NGINX for Azure resource (nginx4a) and from the left pane click on `Monitoring > Metrics`.

1. Within the chart pane, click on **Metric Namespace** drop-down and select `nginx upstream statistics`. For the **metrics** drop-down, select `plus.http.upstream.peers.response.time`. For the **Aggregation** drop-down, select `Avg`.

    Click on the **Add filter** button. Within the **Property** drop-down, select `upstream`. Leave the **Operator** to `=`. In **values** drop-down, `cafe_nginx`.

    Click on the **Apply Splitting** button. Within the **Values** drop-down, select `upstream`. From top right change the **Time range** to `Last 30 minutes` and click on `Apply`. This should generate a chart similar to below screenshot.

    ![upstream response time chart](images/lab3_upstream_response_time_chart.png)

1. You will now pin this chart to your custom dashboard. Within the chart pane, click on `Save to dashboard > Pin to dashboard`.

    Within the `Pin to dashboard` pane, by default the `Existing` tab should be open with your recently created dashboard selected. Click on `Pin` button to pin the chart to your dashboard.

    ![pin upstream chart](images/lab3_pin_upstream_chart.png)

1. Navigate back to `Dashboard` resource within Azure portal and select your dashboard. You will notice that the chart that you recently pinned shows up in your dashboard.

    ![upstream chart dashboard](images/lab3_upstream_chart_dashboard.png)

    You can also edit your dashboard by clicking on the pencil icon to reposition/resize charts as per your taste.

1. Please look into the [References](#references) section to check the metric catalog and explore various other metrics available with NGINX for Azure. Feel free to play around and pin multiple metrics to your dashboard.
